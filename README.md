Radix sort implemented in python 3.13
Uses numpy, math, and random modules

Uses the Least-Significant-Digit approach

example:
list is 12,34,51,10

program groups numbers by digit starting in 1s place and outputs list:
10,51,12,34

repeats on next digit and returns:
10,12,34,51

this approch uses no comparisons and is also a stable sort,
meaning multiple datapoints with the same value are in the same order they were before sorting
